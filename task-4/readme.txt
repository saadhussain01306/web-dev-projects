### Overview
This HTML and PHP script is designed to fetch student details from a database based on the input name and USN (University Seat Number), display these details in a table, and append the details to a CSV file. It also provides a link to view or download the CSV file.

### HTML and CSS

#### Structure
1. **Form**:
   - An HTML form is used to collect the student's name and USN.
   - The form uses the POST method to send data to the server for processing.
   - The form includes text inputs for the student's name and USN and a submit button to fetch the details.

2. **Table**:
   - A table is dynamically generated by PHP to display the fetched student details if found.

3. **CSV Link**:
   - A link is provided to view or download the CSV file containing the student details.

#### Styling
1. **General Styling**:
   - The body is styled to be centered with a maximum width of 500px and a light background color.
   - The form inputs and submit button are styled for consistency and usability, with padding, border-radius, and hover effects.

2. **Table Styling**:
   - The table is styled to be 100% width with collapsed borders and padding for readability.
   - Table headers have a distinct background color for differentiation.

### PHP Script

#### Form Handling
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The script retrieves the name and USN from the form using the `$_POST` superglobal.

2. **Database Connection**:
   - A connection to the MySQL database `cpga_names` is established using the `mysqli` class.
   - Error handling is included to check if the connection fails.

3. **Query Execution**:
   - A SQL query is constructed to fetch the student details based on the provided name and USN.
   - The `ROUND` function is used in the query to round the CGPA to 2 decimal places.

4. **Result Handling**:
   - If the query returns results, a table is generated and displayed with the student details.
   - Each students details are also appended to a CSV file named `students.csv`.

5. **CSV File Handling**:
   - The script opens the `students.csv` file in append mode.
   - The student details are written to the CSV file using the `fputcsv` function.
   - The file is then closed.

6. **Link to CSV**:
   - A link is provided to view or download the `students.csv` file if student details are found and written to the file.

7. **Closing Connection**:
   - The database connection is closed after the query is executed.
