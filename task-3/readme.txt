### Overview
This HTML and PHP script is designed to fetch and display student details from a database based on the input name and USN (University Seat Number). It features an HTML form for user input and a PHP script for processing the input and querying the database. It also includes some JavaScript for additional functionality.

### HTML and CSS

#### Structure
1. **Form**:
   - A form is used to collect the students name and USN.
   - When the form is submitted, it sends the data to the server using the POST method.

2. **Table**:
   - A table is dynamically generated by PHP to display the fetched student details.

3. **Button**:
   - A button is provided to clear the form and any displayed results.

#### Styling
1. **General Styling**:
   - The page is styled to be centered with a maximum width of 500px and a light background color.
   - Elements within the form, such as inputs and the submit button, are styled for consistency and usability.

2. **Table Styling**:
   - The table is styled to be 100% width with collapsed borders and padding for readability.
   - Table headers have a distinct background color for differentiation.

### PHP Script

#### Form Handling
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The script retrieves the name and USN from the form using the `$_POST` superglobal.

2. **Database Connection**:
   - A connection to the MySQL database `cpga_names` is established using the `mysqli` class.
   - Error handling is included to check if the connection fails.

3. **Query Execution**:
   - A SQL query is constructed to fetch the student details based on the provided name and USN.
   - The `ROUND` function is used in the query to round the CGPA to 2 decimal places.

4. **Result Handling**:
   - If the query returns results, a table is generated and displayed with the student details.
   - If no results are found, a message is displayed indicating that no student was found.

5. **Closing Connection**:
   - The database connection is closed after the query is executed.

### JavaScript

#### Clear Entries Functionality
1. **Event Listener**:
   - An event listener is attached to the "Clear Entries" button.
   
2. **Reset Form**:
   - The form is reset using the `reset` method, clearing all input fields.

3. **Remove Table**:
   - If a table is present on the page, it is removed.
